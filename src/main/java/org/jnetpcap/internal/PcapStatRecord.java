/**
 * Packet statistics from the start of the pcap run to the time of the call.
 *
 * <p>
 * A struct pcap_stat has the following members:
 * <dl>
 * <dt>ps_recv</dt>
 * <dd>number of packets received;</dd>
 * <dt>ps_drop</dt>
 * <dd>number of packets dropped because there was no room in the operating
 * system's buffer when they arrived, because packets weren't being read fast
 * enough;</dd>
 * <dt>ps_ifdrop</dt>
 * <dd>number of packets dropped by the network interface or its driver.</dd>
 * </dl>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The statistics do not behave the same way on all platforms. ps_recv might
 * count packets whether they passed any filter set with pcap_setfilter(3PCAP)
 * or not, or it might count only packets that pass the filter. It also might,
 * or might not, count packets dropped because there was no room in the
 * operating system's buffer when they arrived. ps_drop is not available on all
 * platforms; it is zero on platforms where it's not available. If packet
 * filtering is done in libpcap, rather than in the operating system, it would
 * count packets that don't pass the filter. Both ps_recv and ps_drop might, or
 * might not, count packets not yet read from the operating system and thus not
 * yet seen by the application. ps_ifdrop might, or might not, be implemented;
 * if it's zero, that might mean that no packets were dropped by the interface,
 * or it might mean that the statistic is unavailable, so it should not be
 * treated as an indication that the interface did not drop any packets.
 * </p>
