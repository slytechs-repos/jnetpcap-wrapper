	 * pcap_compile() is used to compile the string str into a filter program. See
	 * pcap-filter(7) for the syntax of that string. fp is a pointer to a
	 * bpf_program struct and is filled in by pcap_compile(). optimize controls
	 * whether optimization on the resulting full is performed. netmask specifies
	 * the IPv4 netmask of the network on which packets are being captured; it is
	 * used only when checking for IPv4 broadcast addresses in the filter program.
	 * If the netmask of the network on which packets are being captured isn't known
	 * to the program, or if packets are being captured on the Linux "any"
	 * pseudo-interface that can capture on more than one network, a value of
	 * PCAP_NETMASK_UNKNOWN can be supplied; tests for IPv4 broadcast addresses will
	 * fail to compile, but all other tests in the filter program will be OK.

	 * NOTE: in libpcap 1.8.0 and later, pcap_compile() can be used in multiple
	 * threads within a single process. However, in earlier versions of libpcap, it
	 * is not safe to use pcap_compile() in multiple threads in a single process
	 * without some form of mutual exclusion allowing only one thread to call it at
