public abstract sealed class Pcap implements AutoCloseable permits Pcap0_4 {

	/**
	 * An interface which provides a hook into Pcap initialization process. Any
	 * missing native library symbols during the low level initialization/static
	 * process are captured and reported to this policy which may log, report, or
	 * even halt the initialization process from continuing.
	 * 
	 * <h2>Logging and handling errors on missing native symbols</h2>
	 * <p>
	 * A policy also defines a logger output destination, a {@code Appendable},
	 * where logs by the default policy on initialization errors are sent. By
	 * default a {@code PrintWriter.nullWriter()} is used which discards all logging
	 * output. Any {@code Appendable} implementing output destination can be used
	 * such as {@code System.err}, {@code StringBuilder}, {@code CharBuffer},
	 * {@code Writer} and so on.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * For quick debugging, the default policy can be used by "turning on" the
	 * logging message consumer using code
	 * {@code LibraryPolicy.setLoggingOutput(System.err)} which will print to
	 * console any native library missing symbols. Again, this output is discarded
	 * by default settings. Can also install a {@code Logger} adapter as well
	 * instead of sending the output to console, while still using the default
	 * policy.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * For more sophisticated library handling, you can install a new policy, that
	 * does or does not rely on the {@link #getLogginOutput()} value. It may also
	 * throw an {@code IllegalStateException} to stop further intialization process
	 * from continuing, or try to attempt a different native loading path or method.
	 * By throwing an exception in the class static initializer, as this would do,
	 * you are preventing the class from loading and initializing the first time an
	 * error is encountered. This allows a second attempt with different native
	 * library loading algorithm. By providing your own policy which overrides the
	 * default native libpcap library loading method
	 * {@link #loadNativePcapLibrary(boolean)}, you load the library yourself. It
	 * calls on the default library initializer, which is a private instance of
	 * {@code ForeignInitializer} class.
	 * </p>
	 * <h3>Native Library Loading</h3>
	 * <p>
	 * You can define several system properties which control the behavior of how
	 * the native pcap library, or one of its derivatives are loaded. These
	 * properties, allow changing of the procedure how the library is located and
	 * how is actually loaded. The defaults for the native library loading
	 * procedure, define a list of possible pcap library undecorated names such as
	 * 'wpcap,npcap,pcap' and utilize the relative
	 * {@link System#loadLibrary(String)} to search for the shared object/native
	 * library.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * By specifying various system properties on the java command line, you can
	 * redefine how, where and what to look for when loading the native library.
	 * </p>
	 * The following properties are used in a search, in the following order:
	 * <dl>
	 * <dt>{@value LibraryPolicy#SYSTEM_PROPERTY_JAVA_LIBRARY_PATH}:</dt>
	 * <dd>Defines directories where the native library will searched for.</dd>
	 * <dt>{@value LibraryPolicy#SYSTEM_PROPERTY_LIBPCAP_FILE}:</dt>
	 * <dd>Defines an absolute directory and decorated filename path to load the
	 * native library using {@link System#load(String)} system call.</dd>
	 * <dt>{@value LibraryPolicy#SYSTEM_PROPERTY_LIBPCAP_FILENAME}:</dt>
	 * <dd>Defines a decorated filename only of the native library. The decorated
	 * filename will be appended to the
	 * {@value LibraryPolicy#SYSTEM_PROPERTY_JAVA_LIBRARY_PATH} and an absolute
	 * library load call will be attempted {@link System#load(String)}.</dd>
	 * <dt>{@value LibraryPolicy#SYSTEM_PROPERTY_LIBPCAP_NAMES}:</dt>
	 * <dd>A comma separated list of undecorated library names. Each of the
	 * undecorated names in the list will be attempted to load using
	 * {@link System#loadLibrary(String)} combined with the
	 * {@value LibraryPolicy#SYSTEM_PROPERTY_JAVA_LIBRARY_PATH} property value.</dd>
	 * <dt>{@value LibraryPolicy#SYSTEM_PROPERTY_SO_EXTENSIONS}:</dt>
	 * <dd>Lastly, as a long-shot attempt, a list of absolute files will be built by
	 * combining all the property values given, with fully decorated filenames which
	 * utilize the provided extensions, to try and locate the native library on the
	 * platform. The default extension list are defined as "so,dylib". Each one will
	 * be tried in turn.

	 * <p>
	 * pcap_stats() fills in the struct pcap_stat pointed to by its second argument.
	 * The values represent packet statistics from the start of the run to the time
	 * of the call.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * pcap_stats() is supported only on live captures, not on ``savefiles''; no
	 * statistics are stored in ``savefiles'', so no statistics are available when
	 * reading from a ``savefile''.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * A struct pcap_stat has the following members:
	 * </p>
	 * <dl>
	 * <dt>ps_recv</dt>
	 * <dd>number of packets received;</dd>
	 * <dt>ps_drop</dt>
	 * <dd>number of packets dropped because there was no room in the operating
	 * system's buffer when they arrived, because packets weren't being read fast
	 * enough;</dd>
	 * <dt>ps_ifdrop</dt>
	 * <dd>number of packets dropped by the network interface or its driver.</dd>
	 * </dl>
	 * <p>
	 * The statistics do not behave the same way on all platforms. ps_recv might
	 * count packets whether they passed any filter set with pcap_setfilter(3PCAP)
	 * or not, or it might count only packets that pass the filter. It also might,
	 * or might not, count packets dropped because there was no room in the
	 * operating system's buffer when they arrived. ps_drop is not available on all
	 * platforms; it is zero on platforms where it's not available. If packet
	 * filtering is done in libpcap, rather than in the operating system, it would
	 * count packets that don't pass the filter. Both ps_recv and ps_drop might, or
	 * might not, count packets not yet read from the operating system and thus not
	 * yet seen by the application. ps_ifdrop might, or might not, be implemented;
	 * if it's zero, that might mean that no packets were dropped by the interface,
	 * or it might mean that the statistic is unavailable, so it should not be
	 * treated as an indication that the interface did not drop any packets.
	 * </p>
